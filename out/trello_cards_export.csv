From @dlemire60 :

1. It would be good to have a toggle to suppress the field definition details in the ERD code that's output, so you can have a simple diagram with just all of the types, or a complete diagram with everything. It wasn't hard to edit out the display tables, but it took a little work.
2. ~~Another useful toggle would be to force all shapes in the GV output to be rectangles. There's nothing really wrong with the mix of ellipses and rectangles in what I got but to a viewer on first glance it probably seems random / arbitrary.~~
3. ~~I notice that none of the links in the GV diagram show cardinality; they're just arrows with a text label to tie them to a field. My hand coded PlantUML text included cardinality and that seems at least a useful option.~~

Branch: warning

‌

Goal:

Plantuml graphics are created by using an external source / server (API) called [plantuml.com](http://plantuml.com ""‌"").   When sending data to [plantuml.com](http://plantuml.com ""‌"") the data is encoded and added to the URL.  The issue is very large schemas create a url that is too long.   When a user clicks the View in Browser button, create a warning model for the user if their plantuml url is larger than 2,000 characters.

‌

Technical Details:

We were unable to locate an exact max character limit, but were able to narrow the limit down to about 2,000 characters or more.  An added layer of complexity is that each browser has it’s own URL length limitation as well, for instance IE is 2,000 characters.

Update: the limitation looks to be more around 10k characters.  Limit set to 8 k.

‌

How to Test:

Create a PlantUML using any of the OSCAL Schemas, they are above 2,000 characters and see if a warning modal is presented to the user.

Create another PlantUML using a small test schema, and verify that a warning modal is not presented.",Done - Sprint #0,"JADN Sandbox, Customer Sync, v0.13.1, MSR, JADN CLI","Matt, Kevin Cressman",,False,2025-07-07T18:33:54.201Z,https://trello.com/c/VwBb2B0w/610-issue-2-plantuml-url-limitation-warning,VwBb2B0w,0,0

64adb99e13eceb7e760c72ba,[enhancement - 3] Ability to select JSON Schema draft version,enhancement,3,"**Revisit this with DK to see if it is still something that’s needed.  The JADN 2.0 Spec references JSON Schema Spec 2020-12 only.**

here's a portion of the JADN --> JSON translation. The JADN info has no ref to any version of JSON schema. The translated file explicitly (line 2) names draft-07. That happens to also be the version used by the CDX but I suspect that's coincidence. Clearly any translation to JSON schema has to pick a version and follow it's conventions, so somewhere along the line apparently draft-07 got the nod.

SPDX is using draft 2019.  Others may be using newer versions.

Draft 07 comes from the jadn-py-pkg as an info constant.

The app needs the ability to enter another schema draft.

‌

I'd consider it very low priority for now, but eventually something will make it an issue. The CDX v1.5 schema is still aligned to draft-07. I'd be willing to be that many orgs creating schemas pick what's current when they get started and stick with it until forced to change for some reason.  SPDX 2.3 cites [https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-09/schema#.](https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-09/schema#. ""‌"")

‌

The JSON schema all versions page includes links to the change sections in the various versions, so it's possible (if hugely tedious) to work that out.

Matt’s Thoughts:
This might be the first big step in going from JSON to JADN.  Upload a JSON file, make sure it’s validate JSON.  Then create a list of possible Types.  Perhaps the list of Types could also be drag-n-drop on the JADN schema.  Or just a simple check list as the user converts the main areas of the JSON schema into JADN.

Branch:

‌

Goal:

John M from the OSCAL initiative would like a schema to provide a list of Allowed Values, as well as, a list of Disallowed values.

‌

Technical Details:

Technically we were thinking about starting with a list of strings entered by the user.  The strings would then be added to a regex which contains logic to do a != on each string.   Below is an example of that regex:

? : `(?!.*(Kaitlyn|Allison))^.*$`

[https://regexr.com/2upd1](https://regexr.com/2upd1 ""‌"")

Once we have strings working, then we can tackle values in a range.  John M provided the example of a Tire Pressure Test.  Allowing only values that are in the range.   This could be another ticket, if needed.

How to Test:

Using the Schema Creator, create a schema that contains a record which also contains a list of strings that are not allowed (option) via the UI.

Save the Schema and go to Message Creation.   Create a Message that using the new Schema.

Save the Message.  Go to the Validation page.

<person id=”1234” name=”Jannie”>
  <occupation>Computer Scientist</occupation>
</person>
```

vs:

```xml
<person>
  <id>1234</id>
  <name>Jannie</name>
  <occupation>Computer Scientist</occupation>
</person>
```

‌

Technical Details:

The technical hurdle we have is detecting if the element contains an id or name field…. for instance personID vs id….  or have the user select if this should be an attribute (which is XML specific…..)

Feature Branch: choice\_combine\_not

Goal / Issue: Sandbox passing validation on a Choice with all Not fields exposed a hole in the existing validation logic. Not is a Field Option applied to fields of AllOf Choice types that disallows values meeting their criteria from passing validation. these types should require at least one field that does not contain this option, where they previously had no such restriction.
A closer review of this area of the logic also exposed an issue with generalized Choice validations that involve fields with multiplicity; this was fixed as part of this same work, and added to the points of this ticket.

Technical Details: updated the Choice and Choice Tests logic in JADN Validation.

How to Test: the Sandbox is able to send data to check against schema instances, and any sent against a schema with all logical Not fields inside of an AllOf Choice should throw an error.

‌

Technical Details:

See Data Translation for the CBOR Annotation Hex view.

You will need to start the ruby docker container/image in order to generate cbor and the annotation hex viewer.

If generating the annotation hex view is a performance hit, then we may need to add a button near the view to generate it separately.  Something to keep an eye on.

Sprint Started: 9/25

Sprint Completed: 10/8

Points: 2

A type that restricts another type inherits its fields. Currently, the Schema Creation page acts like Enumerated(Enum) and removes the option to add fields, since the new type should only be a subset of the restricted type. However, the user should be able to add a field with the same id as an inherited field to overwrite that field.

Need to add schema creation logic to overwrite inherited fields.

Also consider: Currently, when a type extends another type, there are repeat ID’s. This could be a problem for restricts.

Example:

Record_1 (1: idx, 2: name)

Record\_2 (extends Record\_1) → (1: idx, 2:name, 1: email)

Now if a type restricts Record_2 and tries to overwrite field with id 1, which one does it overwrite? Need to have unique ID’s.

If an individual type does not define an explicit limit, it uses the limit shown in the package's $MaxBinary, $MaxString, or $MaxElements configuration variable ([Section 6](https://docs.oasis-open.org/openc2/jadn/v1.0/cs01/jadn-v1.0-cs01.html#6-schema-packages ""‌"")). If the specification does not define a limit, the definition defaults to the values shown here, which are deliberately conservative to encourage specification authors to define limits based on application requirements.

- JADN specifications SHOULD define size limits on the variable-length types shown in Figure 3-2.
- Specifications that do not define alternate size limits SHOULD use the limits shown in Figure 3-2.

```
Type                Name           Limit   Description

Hi Matthew,

Since Kestrel 1.8, we repackaged the runtime to be more modular (so a user may choose to install the minimal dependencies).

For OpenC2 use, people do not need Jupyter, but need the basic stix-shifter interface. To select the minimal packages to install for Kestrel:

kestrel-core 1.8 (mandatory)
kestrel-datasource-stixbundle 1.8.0 (required by most demos)
kestrel-datasource-stixshifter 1.8.0 (required by most demos to connect to a real data source like Elasticsearch)
kestrel-analytics-python 1.8.0 (need it if running any Python analytics in a huntflow)
kestrel-analytics-docker 1.8.0 (probably no need to install; need it if running any analytics in Docker)

For end-user, they will just do `pip install kestrel-jupyter` to install everything with Jupyter, but that is a lot more dependencies.

Best,

When creating a schema and adding a string type a user can select the regex format option AND select pattern.  Only one or the other should be allowed, having both at the same time does not make logical sense.

”FedRAMP has approved using OSCAL for assessment of CSP security controls. “

For example, FedRAMP Guide to OSCAL stated: ""provides guidance and examples for an organization producing and using OSCAL-based, FedRAMP-compliant files.”

From Dave L:

FedRAMP is a government program related to security eval of cloud-based systems.  [https://www.fedramp.gov/program-basics/](https://www.fedramp.gov/program-basics/ ""smartCard-inline"")

There is an IC-GovCloud used by the Intelligence Community. I could speculate that John's goal is to apply FedRAMP techniques to A&A of IC-GovCloud systems. But that's purely speculation. Could also be for system on the customer's internal infrastructure.
[10:45 AM]
As I understand it, FedRAMP is basically there to answer the question ""How do we apply the NIST RIsk Management Framework to cloud-based systems for security assessment & authorization?""

FedRAMP is FISMA for the cloud.  Gov security policies for servers, in this case the cloud.

OSCAL is the Open Security Controls Assessment Language. If you look at the NIST OSCAL site, it talks about Automated Control-Based Assessment.

According to my understanding, you can use predefined machine-readable documents, written in OSCAL format, and run tools (scripts) to get security control assessment results. If the tool is running on the machine, which security controls you are assessing, there are no needs for OpenC2. If you are running the tool from the central computer and trying to assess other computer(s), there is opportunity to use OpenC2 to send commands and collect the assessment results.

- General Purpose:`This open-source, tool offers a convenient way to manipulate OSCAL and Metaschema based content supporting the following operations:- Converting OSCAL content between the OSCAL XML, JSON, and YAML formats.- Validating an OSCAL resources to ensure it is well-formed and valid.- Resolving OSCAL Profiles.- Validating a Metaschema model definition to ensure it is well-formed and valid.- Generating XML and JSON Schemas from a Metaschema model definition.This work is intended to make it easier for OSCAL and Metaschema content authors to work with related content.`
- Coding Languages: Java, but I have to mention that there are other languages such as python, xml, json, markdown, html, and so many more.
- Frameworks: The oscal-cli repos is based on Java and Apache Framework.
- Servers: Java engine and Maven engine are used in this project as servers.
- Interaction Type (Web page, CLI, API, etc): CLI
- Possible interactions (Provide examples and/or screen shots): Testing the functionality of cli-core using JUnit testing, here is the screenshoot.

- General Assessment (Thoughts, concerns, improvements?): This Oscar-cli repos mainly has two sub-repos, the cli-core and the cli-framework. The cli-core repos’s working tree is based on Java framework. The structure classes and the test class did have some issues, which I cannot mention one by one because they are a lot and basically similar issues in all classes. But one little detail I can tell about these issues is that, some were improper imports, and others were errors in the code, by not calling the proper classes names. I fixed all these errors and tested the codes using JUnit testing and Maven commands, all tests passed. Similar to the cli-core repos, the cli-framework repos is also mainly Java. This time around, the code didn’t have any major error as in the previous repos. All I had to do is to fix little programmer mistakes and test the codes like I did in the previous repos, and all the tests passed.  Based on the two analyzes of the two sub-repos, we can see my thoughts of how the oscal-cli is constructed, the concerns in its sub-repos, and how I fixed the issues or how they could have improved their codes.
  Below is one of the test results using Maven command.

- Useful Information in OSCAL Formats: NIST, in collaboration with industry, is developing the Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL). OSCAL is a set of formats expressed in XML, JSON, and YAML. These formats provide machine-readable representations of control catalogs, control baselines, system security plans, and assessment plans and results. Control-based information expressed using OSCAL formats allows you to:
  - Easily access control information from security and privacy control catalogs
  - Establish and share machine-readable control baselines
  - Maintain and share actionable, up-to-date information about how controls are implemented in your systems

Task:

Add FastAPI to the app.  Add logic from the API to call oc2/message_manager.py, which should hit Kestrel and return data.

‌

General Flow:

Something sends an OpenC2 command to a Device API <to be created using FastAPI>  ->

The API does some preliminary checks (don’t put too much logic in the API though), then calls an other py file to handle the grunt of the logic needed to complete mappings and to do the work.   Example: oc2/message_manager.py  ->

return data back to the API, which then returns data back to the requester

OK, this is interesting, and a bit complicated to describe:

1. create a record field (serialNumber) in the bom record, assign it type String with a pattern, which triggers a system-generated type (Bom$serialNumber) when visualized in JIDL.
2. define a new separate SerialNumber type of String with the same pattern, to eliminate the system-generated type need.
3. change the record field type for bom/serialNumber from String to SerialNumber
4. validate the JADN and get an error that the pattern (specified for the original String type in the record) isn't appropriate to the new SerialNumber type. When I vew the JADN the pattern is still there in the field options even though the field type has changed.
5. to delete the now-obsolete pattern for bom/serialNumber in the Creator, I had to change the field type back to the String to see the pattern option, then change its type back to SerialNumber.

I haven't really thought through the right behavior here, but maybe something on the order of ""delete all previous field options when a field's type is changed"" might be appropriate?",Monthly Snapshot - Jul 2023,"JADN Sandbox, Customer Sync",,,False,2024-09-12T14:37:10.758Z,https://trello.com/c/A0azVdmQ/223-issue-2-create-schema-field-onchg-fix,A0azVdmQ,0,0

**Issue encountered**: adding Config to Info > adding data > clearing/removing said data = err due to empty string.

Conclusion: adding config = must be all or none ?

Configurations are not set in the create/schema side. So my previous changes made to conform create/msg to custom config is only partially complete.

**Solution P1**: Set Config default if field is falsy.

**See Attached Trello Card for P2.**

**Other issue**: Having a schema and then changing/adding config which does not conform to the schema. This would lead to an invalid schema. Note that only the new fields get validated against the new config variables. >>> How to validate schema after change?

From @:5588455b77ef325e48eba60c :

1. It would be good to have a toggle to suppress the field definition details in the ERD code that's output, so you can have a simple diagram with just all of the types, or a complete diagram with everything. It wasn't hard to edit out the display tables, but it took a little work.
2. ~~Another useful toggle would be to force all shapes in the GV output to be rectangles. There's nothing really wrong with the mix of ellipses and rectangles in what I got but to a viewer on first glance it probably seems random / arbitrary.~~
3. ~~I notice that none of the links in the GV diagram show cardinality; they're just arrows with a text label to tie them to a field. My hand coded PlantUML text included cardinality and that seems at least a useful option.~~

‌

Goal:

Plantuml graphics are created by using an external source / server (API) called [plantuml.com](http://plantuml.com ""‌"").   When sending data to [plantuml.com](http://plantuml.com ""‌"") the data is encoded and added to the URL.  The issue is very large schemas create a url that is too long.   When a user clicks the View in Browser button, create a warning model for the user if their plantuml url is larger than 2,000 characters.

‌

Technical Details:

We were unable to locate an exact max character limit, but were able to narrow the limit down to about 2,000 characters or more.  An added layer of complexity is that each browser has it’s own URL length limitation as well, for instance IE is 2,000 characters.

Update: the limitation looks to be more around 10k characters.  Limit set to 8 k.

‌

How to Test:

Create a PlantUML using any of the OSCAL Schemas, they are above 2,000 characters and see if a warning modal is presented to the user.

Create another PlantUML using a small test schema, and verify that a warning modal is not presented.",Sprint #0 - Complete,"JADN Sandbox, Customer Sync, v0.13.1, MSR","Matt, Kevin Cressman",,False,2025-07-11T15:06:15.738Z,https://trello.com/c/iB91eHcr/438-issue-2-plantuml-url-limitation-warning,iB91eHcr,0,0

Issue: When using the new data validation sometimes errors are duplicated.  Also sometimes, the previous error is stacked on top of the new error, as if it wasn’t cleared.

Resolution: Review error handling logic and see if it can be simplified or identify where the dups are originating.   The jadn validation logic and jadn  sandbox api logic will both need to be researched and debugged.

Date and Time addons are provided in the Data Creation page for specific format inputs. these are very helpful, but have shown issues in implementation.
~~- date input by selection only allows today and future dates to be selected; users may manually enter prior dates.~~
\- time inputs always contain AM / PM. checking to see if this is correctly representing JADN time or if that may also be used for duration.

issues appear on multiple browsers with some display differences but same overall constraints.

Technical Note:

The calendar uses an input type of time or date and time, these add AM/PM to the display per HTML5.  A work around would be to just use separate integer inputs for time and then, combine then on the JS side.

‌

Goal / Issue:

The Data Translation page provides a raw CBOR view as well as a visual CBOR Annotation Hex view.  This could be included on the Data Creation page to provide a visual of the CBOR data, in addition this would allow highlighting to work with CBOR data at least in the Annotation Hex viewer.

‌

Technical Details:

See Data Translation for the CBOR Annotation Hex view.

You will need to start the ruby docker container/image in order to generate cbor and the annotation hex viewer.

If generating the annotation hex view is a performance hit, then we may need to add a button near the view to generate it separately.  Something to keep an eye on.

Sprint Started: 9/25

Sprint Completed: 10/8

Points: 2

A type that restricts another type inherits its fields. Currently, the Schema Creation page acts like Enumerated(Enum) and removes the option to add fields, since the new type should only be a subset of the restricted type. However, the user should be able to add a field with the same id as an inherited field to overwrite that field.

Need to add schema creation logic to overwrite inherited fields.

Also consider: Currently, when a type extends another type, there are repeat ID’s. This could be a problem for restricts.

Example:

Record_1 (1: idx, 2: name)

Record\_2 (extends Record\_1) → (1: idx, 2:name, 1: email)

Now if a type restricts Record_2 and tries to overwrite field with id 1, which one does it overwrite? Need to have unique ID’s.

jadn-utils: run unit tests (includes all examples from spec and more)

jadn-cli: run unit tests, and manually try data_c command

- python jadn\_cli.py data\_c music-database.jadn music_library.json --concise
- python jadn\_cli.py data\_c 1 1 --concise
- python jadn\_cli.py data\_c 1 → 1 → 2
- python jadn\_cli.py → data\_c → 1 → 1 → 2

jadn-sandbox: use button & review results. Yellow means Compact as shown by the alt text. Red is concise.

68c1ac419d6fe77318e54650,[essential - 4] JADN Validation: add Keyless Map and Field Aliases Options,essential,4,"Current JADN Metaschema based validations run into an issue validating vs Options, as JADN options are being redefined away from a list of Strings into a series of Maps. while the current schema is a work in progress, the exception-based treatment of Options in JSON serialization is causing issues.
A possible solution to this involves defining a new option for Map type data that serializes in JSON as an Array of Strings, where each String contains a key field and a value appended together. the option will contain an integer value to denote a number of characters at which to split the strings to parse the keys from the values.
Tests will need to be put in place. using Options as a base will help to clarify the purpose of this option and form a basis for the test framework.

This is related to the overall initiative of JADN metaschema-based validation for Options.
Additionally, a method to alias option characters with their string names is being put in place so that this structure, when created, will be able to be used with the JADN Options which have full string names in the metaschema but only signifier characters in the JADN data.

‌

Repo: jadn-cli

Branch: schema\_vis\_opts

‌

Goal / Issue:

Improve on the schema_vis command to allow the user to send in opts arguments.  Each visualization type has different options that a user could send in.  If the user does not send in opts, then prompt them if they are good with the defaults.

‌

Technical Details:

Look at the jadn-sandbox / server / webApp / views / api / [convert.py](http://convert.py ""‌"") / convertTo definition.

The convertTo definition allows users to pass in opts for gv and puml.  Allow the CLI to do the same, if the user selects gv or puml as their convertTo option.

This definition also contains the defaults and the format that the data should be in when calling `jadn.convert.diagram_dumps(`….

Opts are as follows:

```
    const conc: string = ""conceptual"";
    const logi: string = ""logical"";
    const info: string = ""information"";
```

How to Test:

Run command and then, check the output to see if the display is using the option selected.  You can also use these online pages to view the output.

Goal / Issue:

JADN Schemas in JADN 2.0 use the term “meta” rather than “info“, we need to make this change across the board.  Starting with the Schema Creation page.

To be in alignment with JADN spec 2.0 perform the following updates to the Schema Creation area of the app:

1. From the jadn-schema repo
   1. Update the jadn dependency to 0.7.5 in the requirements.txt
   2. Search repo’s codebase for “info” and change to “meta”.
   3. Attempt to create a unit test to test the change (adding unit tests to this repo have not been easily done)
   4. Build a new whl version of the repo
      1. delete jadnschema.egg-info
      2. update setup.cfg with version 0.4.0
      3. run: `python setup.py bdist_wheel --universal`
      4. Review and attempt to fix issues that may popup
2. From the jadn-sandbox repo
   1. Copy the whl from the jadn-schema dist dir and paste it into the jadn-sandbox server / whls directory
   2. Delete the old jadn-schema 0.3.0 whl
   3. Update the requirements.txt to use jadnschema 0.4.0
   4. pip uninstall jadnschema
   5. pip install the updated requirements: pip install -r requiremements.txt
   6. Search repo’s codebase under Schema Creation for “info” and change to “meta”.
   7. To test, attempt to start the app up and use the Schema Creation page, add some meta data, check out the json view, etc
   8. Resolve issues that may popup
   9. Once the Schema Creation page works well again, then commit our code to your feature branch and move the ticket to Code Review

Goal / Issue:

In the jadn-xml repo there should be some attribute logic already... the review part will be to find this and then decide if it needs to be adjusted in order to validate attribute data in xml or not. Maybe its good... my guess is, it needs some work.

Also, I'm pretty sure the logic doesn't know to look in JADN field options for /attr, this will need to be added.

‌

Goal:

Some Schema files provide a uuid per tag.  This functionality would allow a user to add a uuid per tag, if selected to do so.

‌

Technical Details:

During translation to json or xsd add the ability to also generate a uuid as an id per tag.

We have an issue though with tags that already contain an id.   Answer TBD.

‌

How to Test:

A checkbox is needed to include uuids within the output of the a schema translation.
